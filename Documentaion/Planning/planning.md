**PLANNING**:
  
  - The main targets of this system:
    - the patient can take turn online by the system
    - Promote a culture that people do their work using online system to save time
    - Over time,the clinic management is going to be able not to hire a secretory to answer to the patient
  - The kind of people that are going to be affected by the system:
    - The doctors
    - The patients
    - The reciption
    - Clinic manager
  - Main tasks for designing system:
     - create a database that contains doctor's main information such as name,Specialty,time of presence at clinic and so on.
     - create a database of patient's main information such as name,age,gender,desease sort,doctor's name and so on;
     - designe a website for clinic that includs clinic's doctor's resume,hours of presence of each doctor in clinic and includes       accounting system for paying visit  
  - Access and allocation of resources:
     - this project needs two web_devlopers,one person will be front_end devloper and another one will be Back_end devloper.
     - It's necessary to use some software such as MSSQL 2014 to do the project.
  - Identify risks and dangers:
     - Excess demand and expectation from the output system must be controlled.
     - The data stored in the database should not be lost.
     - All activities must be done according to their own schedule.
