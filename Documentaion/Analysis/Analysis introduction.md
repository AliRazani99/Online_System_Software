- **ANALYSIS**
   - The problem that caused us to design this system(Recognize the problem):
     - the patient to take turn,had to call the reception of the clinic that most of the time it makes the Secretary and the patient confused
     - some patients to take turn,refer to clinic that it makes clinic busy(that it really is on nerve!)
     - it makes mistakes and disorder,when the secretory uses papers to giving turns to patient.

   - Hypothesized:
     - The use of traditional methods and the lack of an online system have caused these problems.
   
   - Collecting information:
     - Using observing and experimenting with previous systems and interviewing patients and physicians, information such as the following information was collected:
  
      1. Existence of irregularities and human mistakes when giving time to the patients
      2. Existence of these kind of mistakes and lack of regular routine causes the office to be crowded and wastes patient's time and also contaminates the office environment         by many patients.
      3. Due to the lack of a regular queuing system,each patient is able to cancle his/her turn with no punishment that it makes bad disorder
  
   - Data analysis:
     - after collecting Data , now is the time to analyze.We want to create a system in which patients do not have to stand in long queues to make appointments, cancel appointments and pay bills. They must be able to receive these services online. Doctors can also serve patients without the need for a secretary and etc.
     - this system will be created by two web devlopers.
     - this system will be created till 10 Tir.
