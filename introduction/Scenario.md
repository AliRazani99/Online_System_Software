# Online patient appointment system
The patient appointment system is a website that includes all the tasks and steps that are done after the patient's request to make an appointment for her/his,including the initial admission and queuing as well as all the departments related to accounting and also the management actions of the system

## how does this system work?
In this system, we have two types of patients:
- the patient who has a history of membership in this system
   - enter the system by giving the main information such as national code
   - the former patient can update her information if necessary
-  the patient who has taken turns in this site for the first  time
   - enter her/his information such as name, national code, phone number
 

 then the patient mentions her/his type of illness and takes her turn
 
 the system uses the doctor's database to give the desired doctor and the hours of her presence in the clinic to the patient, then the patient enters her desired date among the available dates

  then the patient is asked to refer to the accounting system to pay for the visit.After payment by the patient, a message is displayed that shows the date and time of appointmentmont
