## System analysis and design



## Project phasing scenario

- **PLANNING**:
   - The problem that caused us to design this system:
     - the patient to take turn,had to call the reception of the clinic that most of the time it makes the Secretary and the patient confused
     - some patients to take turn,refer to clinic that it makes clinic busy(that it really is on nerve!)
     - it makes mistakes and disorder,when the secretory uses papers to giving turns to patient
  - The main targets of this system:
    - the patient can take turn online by the system
    - Promote a culture that people do their work using online system to save time
    - Over time,the clinic management is going to be able not to hire a secretory to answer to the patient
  - The kind of people that are going to be affected by the system:
    - The doctors
    - The patients
    - The reciption
    - Clinic manager
  - Main tasks for designing system:
    - create a database that contains doctor's main information such as name,Specialty,time of presence at clinic and so on.
    - create a database of patient's main information such as name,age,gender,desease sort,doctor's name and so on;
    - designe a website for clinic that includs clinic's doctor's resume,hours of presence of each doctor in clinic and includes accounting system for paying visit
