- **ANALYSIS**
  - Business analysis:
    - main Problems related to current system includes:
      1. Existence of irregularities and human mistakes when giving time to the patients
      2. Existence of these kind of mistakes and lack of regular routine causes the office to be crowded and wastes patient's time and also contaminates the office environment         by many patients.
      3. Due to the lack of a regular queuing system,each patient is able to cancle his/her turn with no punishment that it makes bad disorder
